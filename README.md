### Hi there 👋

Most repositories here are historical experiments or one-off utilities: unmaintained, frequently outdated, and sometimes outright broken against current runtimes or dependencies. Treat everything as read-only reference unless clearly marked otherwise. I archive projects once I’m certain I won’t touch them again, but many remain “soft abandoned” for browsing.

If you find something useful: fork freely, adapt it, and don’t wait on me for updates. Issues and pull requests may sit unanswered unless I’m actively revisiting that area. Additions that modernize tooling are welcome but not guaranteed to merge. For anything security-sensitive or production-bound, start fresh.
